# Validation — Resideo Native 0.3.1

This release consolidates the schedule work developed on **27 October 2026**.
The runtime comes from the supplied `resideo-native-0.3.1-sleep-payload-fix.zip`.
[The complete implementation and test summary](docs/TESTING_2026-10-27.md) separates
reported physical tests, local automated checks and remaining gaps.

## Physical-device evidence

| Owner / environment | Hardware | Confirmed scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Maintainer | Owner-described Lyric T6 Pro, internally Jasper; owner-reported firmware 6.0.1.50 | HVAC mode, temperature and hold/preset operation; earlier heating schedule edit visible in the official app; later Geofencing use reported in issue #4 |
| ryanpalfrey, UK/EMEA, HA OS 2026.10.4 | Two Honeywell Home Lyric T6R T6H700RW4011 thermostats, Jasper, firmware 6.0.1.50, gas heating, one heat stage / no cooling | Both heating-zone reads; schedule row/day deletion and restoration with whole-week comparison; verified 0.3.1 writes; real HVAC Off accepted/reported on both zones |
| Same requester/account | Actual nested DHW zone on the downstairs system | State and on/off/auto, HA-started boost, schedule time edit on the 10-minute grid, day clearing/restoration and verified 0.3.1 readback |

The exact retail product code is established for the requester's thermostats.
Home Assistant's registry does not expose firmware (`sw_version` was null in the
maintainer inspection); firmware above is owner/app-reported, not invented from
that registry. These reports do not establish behavior on every Jasper variant.

Source comments: [0.3.1 retest](https://github.com/Kosztyk/resideo_native/issues/4#issuecomment-6451958914),
[hardware and DHW evidence](https://github.com/Kosztyk/resideo_native/issues/4#issuecomment-6452463318),
[product code and Off](https://github.com/Kosztyk/resideo_native/issues/4#issuecomment-6454440807),
and [maintainer Geofencing report](https://github.com/Kosztyk/resideo_native/issues/4#issuecomment-6452157609).

The original maintainer command evidence covers `set_mode`, `set_temperature`
and `set_hold`. The requester's later feedback reports that a temperature edit
can replace a permanent hold with a temporary one; their working order is
**temperature first, then Permanent hold**. No new live fix for that observation
is claimed in this release.

## Automated checks

The 0.3.1 source passed **230 Python/HA tests plus 55 subtests**, **36 JavaScript
tests** and **49 Chromium browser checks**. The Python harness is pinned to
Home Assistant 2026.10.2 / Python 3.14; the local run uses Python 3.14.8. There
are 29 existing IPv6 loopback warnings from the restricted test socket fixture.

The protocol tests use synthetic accounts and a localhost HTTP server. Browser
checks run the actual local JavaScript in Chromium against a synthetic HA API
and simulated native entity rows. They do not contact a real thermostat.

Coverage includes OAuth/session handling, Celsius/Fahrenheit conversion,
command validation, exact routes/bodies, parent DHW addressing, entity and
account lifecycle, diagnostics redaction, revision conflicts, untouched-day
preservation, EMEA field filtering, empty-day validation, DHW time increments,
bounded GET readback, no repeated PUT, visible switches, review/cancel flows,
sidebar preferences, backups, sleep creation/edit/removal and mobile layout.

The sleep regression first failed against 0.3.0's flat payload, then passed
against the app's final `sleepMode.triggers` serializer with all seven days.
Day order and time formatting may differ without causing a false mismatch;
missing/subset days or different values cannot confirm a new sleep write.
See [the APK trace](docs/SLEEP_PROTOCOL.md).

## HACS, Hassfest and publication

[Validate Resideo Native](https://github.com/Kosztyk/resideo_native/actions/workflows/validate.yml)
runs five independent jobs: packaging/Python compilation, the Python/HA suite,
JavaScript/browser checks, **HACS Validation** and **Hassfest Validation**.
No HACS checks are ignored. The release workflow publishes v0.3.1 only when all
jobs succeed on a push to the current main commit. Its release body records the
exact validated commit and workflow-run link. The CI checks on that commit are
the authoritative remote result, rather than a local packaging check alone.

## Limits and frost protection

The requester did not test the visual editor or either mode popup, Geofencing,
sleep, or first-time creation/conversion. The maintainer reports Geofencing
works, but specific live sleep acceptance and a complete current popup/Timed
conversion test are not established. Individual boost durations and explicit
boost cancellation were not separately reported. Native schedule On/Off is
separate from HVAC Off and holds; a full hardware Off-to-On cycle is not
established by the requester's HVAC Off test.

Resideo documents integral 5°C frost protection in Off mode for European
T6/T6R. The requester confirms their fixed setting/no app page and real Off
command acceptance. No cooling-to-threshold test or live cloud frost sensor is
claimed. No frost switch or raw-response export is added.

No new live heating commands, Home Assistant installation or restart are part
of publishing this release. Existing owner test reports supply hardware evidence.
